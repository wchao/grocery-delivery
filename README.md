# Grocery delivery software

Like many people during COVID-19, I spend lots of time trying to reserve a delivery time slot on grocery delivery sites (FreshDirect, Amazon Fresh, Instacart). I wrote this software so I could get a time slot without sitting around refreshing the page for hours.

## Usage

Supports **MacOS, Linux, and Windows**.

The script works on **Chrome**.

1. Clone the project.
1. Run the requirements.txt (```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```).
2. Run freshdirect_slot_chrome.py (``` $ python freshdirect_slot_chrome.py```).
